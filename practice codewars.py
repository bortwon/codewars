# Beginner Series #3 Sum of Numbers
#
#
# Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including
# them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.
#
# Note: a and b are not ordered!

def get_sum(a,b):
    if a == b:
        return a
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    list = [i for i in range(int(a), int(b) + 1)]
    list.sort()
    counter = 0
    for i in list:
        counter += i
    return counter
