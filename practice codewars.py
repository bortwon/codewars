# Beginner Series #3 Sum of Numbers
#
#
# Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including
# them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.
#
# Note: a and b are not ordered!

# For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

# Example
# For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15], you should return [10, -65].

# Note: This kata is inspired by Convert a Number to a String!. Try that one too.
#
# Description
# We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?
#
# Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.
#
# Examples
# "1234" --> 1234
# "605"  --> 605
# "1405" --> 1405
# "-7" --> -7
