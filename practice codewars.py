# Equal Sides Of An Array
#
# You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of
# the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would
# make this happen, return -1.
#
# For example:
#
# Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:
# Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index
# ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.
#
# Let's look at another one.
# You are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:
# Your function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index
# ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.
#
# Last one:
# You are given the array {20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}
# At index 0 the left side is {}
# The right side is {10,-80,10,10,15,35}
# They both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)
# Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.
#
# Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.
#
# Input:
# An integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.
#
# Output:
# The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index
# that fits these rules, then you will return -1.
#
# Note:
# If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.

# lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

# Mexican Wave
#
# Introduction
# The wave (known as the Mexican wave in the English-speaking world outside North America) is an example of metachronal
# rhythm achieved in a packed stadium when successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell, and raise their arms.
# Immediately upon stretching to full height, the spectator returns to the usual seated position.
#
# The result is a wave of standing spectators that travels through the crowd, even though individual spectators never
# move away from their seats. In many large arenas the crowd is seated in a contiguous circuit all the way around the
# sport field, and so the wave is able to travel continuously around the arena; in discontiguous seating arrangements,
# the wave can instead reflect back and forth through the crowd. When the gap in seating is narrow, the wave can
# sometimes pass through it. Usually only one wave crest will be present at any given time in an arena, although
# simultaneous, counter-rotating waves have been produced. (Source Wikipedia)
# Task
# In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a
# string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.
# Rules
#  1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.
#
#  2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat
# Example
# wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]

# Directions Reduction
#
# Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west,â€¦
# â€¦ a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST".
# Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.
#
# Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort. Since this is the wild
# west, with dreadful weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die
# of thirst!
#
# How I crossed a mountainous desert the smart way.
# The directions given to the man are, for example, the following (depending on the language):
#
# ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
# or
# { "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
# or
# [North, South, South, East, West, North, West]
# You can immediately see that going "NORTH" and immediately "SOUTH" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place!
# So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:
#
# ["WEST"]
# or
# { "WEST" }
# or
# [West]
# Other examples:
# In ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"], the direction "NORTH" + "SOUTH" is going north and coming back right away.
#
# The path becomes ["EAST", "WEST"], now "EAST" and "WEST" annihilate each other, therefore, the final
# result is [] (nil in Clojure).
#
# In ["NORTH", "EAST", "WEST", "SOUTH", "WEST", "WEST"], "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are not directly opposite but they
# become directly opposite after the reduction of "EAST" and "WEST" so the whole path is reducible to ["WEST", "WEST"].
#
# Task
# Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless
# directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).
#
# The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South.
# The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
# The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {North, East, West, South}.
# See more examples in "Sample Tests:"
# Notes
# Not all paths can be made simpler. The path ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"] is not reducible.
# "NORTH" and "WEST", "WEST" and "SOUTH", "SOUTH" and "EAST" are not directly opposite of each other and can't
# become such. Hence the result path is itself : ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"].

# 7 kyu
# Two to One

# Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible,
# containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.
#
# Examples:
# a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
# b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
# longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"
#
# a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

    return "".join(sorted([c for c in set(s1 + s2)]))



# 6 kyu
# Simple Encryption #1 - Alternating Split
#
# Implement a pseudo-encryption algorithm which given a string S and an integer N concatenates all the odd-indexed
# characters of S with all the even-indexed characters of S, this process should be repeated N times.
#
# Examples:
#
# encrypt("012345", 1)  =>  "135024"
# encrypt("012345", 2)  =>  "135024"  ->  "304152"
# encrypt("012345", 3)  =>  "135024"  ->  "304152"  ->  "012345"
#
# encrypt("01234", 1)  =>  "13024"
# encrypt("01234", 2)  =>  "13024"  ->  "32104"
# encrypt("01234", 3)  =>  "13024"  ->  "32104"  ->  "20314"
# Together with the encryption function, you should also implement a decryption function which reverses the process.
#
# If the string S is an empty value or the integer N is not positive, return the first argument without changes.
